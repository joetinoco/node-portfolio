<h2>My education</h2>
<ul class="collection">
  <li class="collection-item">I learned to code when I was 14 years old, in high school. From there I went straight to a <strong>bachelor's in Computer Science</strong>.</li>
  <li class="collection-item">By the end of 2016, I'll also have an <strong>Advanced Diploma in Software Engineering Technology</strong>. My GPA so far is 4.3/4.5.</li>
  <li class="collection-item">I have project management certifications: I'm a <strong>PMP</strong> and a <strong>Certified Scrum Master</strong>.</li>
  <li class="collection-item">This list is never-ending: I aim to learn something new every day and keep myself up to date with side projects and self-study.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tech skills</h2>
<ul class="collection">
  <li class="collection-item">I'm very experienced with <strong>full stack web development</strong> using <strong>JavaScript</strong> and related technologies like <strong>Meteor</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>jQuery</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong> and <strong>APIs</strong> like Wikipedia, Twitter and Google Maps. On the back-end I do well with <strong>PHP</strong> and databases like <strong>MySQL</strong>, and I also know a little about <strong>MongoDB</strong>.</li>
  <li class="collection-item">I'm quite comfortable coding in <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>.NET (C#)</strong> and even <strong>VBA</strong> if the client won't give up his Excel spreadsheets. My <strong>SQL</strong> knowledge is very strong, too.</li>
  <li class="collection-item">I can work in the <strong>Windows</strong> or <strong>Unix/Linux</strong> world and know a fair bit about <strong>Apache</strong>, too. I have lots of experience with <strong>Git/GitHub</strong> and <strong>JIRA</strong> for bug-tracking and task management.</li>
  <li class="collection-item">This year I'm taking courses on <strong>JavaEE</strong> and <strong>mobile (Android) development</strong>, so I'll be good to go with those in no time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Professional history and goals</h2>
  <p>My first job out of university was a programmer analyst position in a local bank. Then I branched into consulting and specialized in project management - a skill that I carried over to the digital advertising industry, where I led important projects for big clients. Many involved innovative technology, and a couple of them were awarded in Cannes.</p>
  <p>My true passion is coding, so I am focused exclusively in developer roles from now on. Along with my current studies, I've been working extensively with modern web development in part-time projects, personal projects and also internships/co-ops. I would also love to work with SaaS or enterprise development - if it is challenging, count me in!</p>
